    "This Notebook uses several Python packages. To avoid compatibility issues we recommend running this Notebook in a __virual environment__.\n",
    "- Therefore, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "- Go to environments and click 'create'. Give your environment a name, for example '__myenv__'. The virual environment will be launched automatically.\n",
    "- Go to the package search bar and search for '__ipywidgets__'. Download the package to be able to use the interactive widgets in this Notebook.\n",
    "- Next, go back to the home page and install __Jupyter Notebook__. Once completed, press launch and go to the directory where you saved this Notebook. \n",
    "- Verify that you see the name of the virtual enivronment on the right top of the Notebook, for example: __Python (myenv)__. If that's not the case, go to Kernel and choose the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow uses several non-Python tools ([CD-HIT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/22/13/1658/194225?login=true), [MAFFT](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/30/14/3059/2904316?login=true) and [FastTree](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/7/1641/1128976?login=true)). To use this Notebook to its full strength, make sure to download these packages and compile them according to your system. Installation instructions can be found on the [GitHub](https://github.com/PyEED/CANDy) page. Make sure you have them installed in the same directory as this Notebook before running.\n",

    "### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "For a large number of sequences, it is useful to perform a clustering step (CD-HIT). This can significantly reduce the number of input sequences and thus speed up the process. Since CANDy focusses on the occurence of entire protein domains, the clustering cut-off can be set quite low (default: 0.85). \n",

    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The found domain architectures can be viualized on a phylogenetic tree, which can be useful for further analysis. When chosen 'Yes' in the dropdown menu, a MSA (MAFFT) and PTI (FastTree) step is performed. This generates a tree file in .nwk format and an [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/) annotation file containing the domain reprentation of each protein.    "
